# Lightweight Vector Database
This repository contains a light-weight vector database written in python. The implementation can't hold up with professional databases but is very fast to setup and and therefore suited for quick experimental setups.

K-nearest neighbor search can be done with **custom distance metrics**!

# Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ChristophervonKlitzing/lightweight_vector_database
```
